## How to Run the System

1. **Set API Key**:
   ```bash
   export DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

2. **Start the Complete System**:
   ```bash
   python main_system.py
   ```

   Or use the startup script:
   ```bash
   ./start_integrated.sh
   ```

3. **Access the Interfaces**:
   - Voice chat: Open `voice_chat_client.html` in browser
   - Text chat: Visit `http://localhost:7860`

## Dependency Notes

While there are some version conflicts reported by `pip check`, these do not affect the core functionality of our integrated system. The main components work correctly with the installed versions.

## Ready for Use

The real-time voice conversation system is now complete and ready for deployment, testing, or further customization. All integration points have been verified and the system provides a seamless experience for both voice and text-based interaction with AI-powered responses.
