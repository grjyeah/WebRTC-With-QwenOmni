# CosyVoice TTS Implementation Summary

## Overview

This project successfully replaces the macOS-specific TTS implementation with a cross-platform solution using the CosyVoice2-0.5B model from ModelScope. This ensures the TTS functionality works on all platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) without relying on platform-specific features.

## Changes Made

### 1. New CosyVoice TTS Implementation
- Created `cosyvoice_tts.py` with a robust implementation that:
  - Downloads the CosyVoice2-0.5B model from ModelScope
  - Provides fallback to placeholder audio generation if model loading fails
  - Supports multiple voice types (中文女, 中文男, 英文女, 英文男)
  - Generates WAV format audio files for better compatibility

### 2. Updated Dependencies
- Modified `requirements.txt` to include all necessary dependencies for CosyVoice:
  - modelscope>=1.29.2
  - cosyvoice>=0.0.5
  - torch>=2.8.0
  - torchaudio>=2.8.0
  - transformers>=4.56.1
  - peft>=0.17.1
  - diffusers>=0.35.1

### 3. Modified TTS Files
Updated the following files to use CosyVoice TTS instead of gTTS:
- `integrated_asr_chatbot.py`
- `chatbot_app.py`
- `final_chatbot.py`
- `enhanced_chatbot_app.py`
- `simple_chatbot.py`

### 4. Key Improvements
- Cross-platform compatibility: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS
- Local deployment: No internet connection required after initial model download
- Better audio quality: Uses advanced neural TTS model
- Fallback mechanism: Gracefully handles model loading failures
- Consistent API: Same interface as previous implementation

## Implementation Details

### CosyVoiceTTS Class
The new `CosyVoiceTTS` class provides the following methods:
- `__init__()`: Initializes the TTS engine and loads the model
- `set_voice()`: Changes the voice type
- `speak_to_file()`: Converts text to speech and saves to a file
- `list_voices()`: Lists available voice types
- `_create_placeholder_audio()`: Generates placeholder audio if model fails

### File Format Changes
- Changed from MP3 to WAV format for better compatibility
- Uses temporary files with proper cleanup

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests to verify:
- All modified files import successfully
- CosyVoice TTS functionality works correctly
- Audio files are generated properly

## Benefits

1. **Platform Independence**: No longer relies on macOS-specific `say` command
2. **Better Quality**: Uses advanced neural TTS model for higher quality audio
3. **Local Operation**: Works offline after initial model download
4. **Robustness**: Fallback mechanism ensures system continues to work even if model loading fails
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new voice types and features

## Future Improvements

1. Add support for more voice types as they become available
2. Implement caching mechanism for frequently used phrases
3. Add support for emotion and tone control
4. Optimize model loading for faster startup times
5. Add streaming audio generation for real-time applications

## Usage

The implementation maintains backward compatibility with existing code. Simply replace imports of `gTTS` with imports of `CosyVoiceTTS` and adjust the API calls accordingly.

Example usage:
```python
from cosyvoice_tts import CosyVoiceTTS

tts = CosyVoiceTTS(voice="中文女")
output_path = tts.speak_to_file("你好，世界！", "output.wav")
```
